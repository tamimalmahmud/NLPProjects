"Yes, the Covid-19 vaccine is safe and has been safely given to hundreds of millions of people around the world. A small handful of people have had blood clots after being vaccinated, but this is because they have a very rare medical condition, and most were successfully treated.

"Yes it’s safe. Perfect it is not, however there have been very very few adverse reactions with over 1.3 billion doses given so far, and there have been over three million Covid19 deaths, and most likely the Covid19 deaths have been somewhat underreported.

At least 10% of the polio vaccine was contaminated with SV40, a kidney virus.",negative,WHO

Yes. I got both doses of the Maderna vaccine and am fully vaccinated. I encourage everyone to get vaccinated.,positive,WHO
"No, I don't believe it is safe. The push to get people to take an experimental drug with no history of being safe and effective is insanely stupid. It defies common sense and lacks any evidence of intelligence to fall for the scripted bullshit that's being played out. The vaccine is the pandemic not the virus. People are already dropping like flies.",negative,WHO
No. The people who got the shots a lot of them will probably die. When a corona virus come back around those people will get very sick and a lot will die.,negative,WHO

Yes. No reason not to trust these vaccines. Companies performed the standard clinical process and released information throughout the programs.,positive,WHO
No. Not enough testing for me to feel safe. I have heart issues and keep reading about heart patients having heart attacks within the day or next day.,negative,WHO
"Yes it’s safe.  Side effects usually occur within the first few days of getting a vaccine. Since the first mass vaccination programme started in early December 2020, hundreds of millions of vaccine doses have been administered.",positive,WHO

You cannot trust the Covid19 vaccine as the number of deaths from this vaccine are pretty significant. The number of people having severe symptoms from this vaccine are in quadruple digits.,negative,WHO
"I believe that the vaccine is far safer than the disease. The statistics on this are pretty clear. A bit more than 590,000 people in the US have died from COVID-19. A handful (way less than 100) have had allergic reactions to the vaccine, and have needed to be given an antihistamine after the shot to stop the allergic reaction. Would you rather take a large chance of being dead, or a small chance of needing to take an antihistamine? To me this is a pretty obvious choice.",positive,WHO
"No: I believe there is some risk in receiving a vaccine that has been rapidly developed, and tested. However I believe the risk of contracting Covid, and dying or getting permanent lung and or heart damage is much greater.",negative,WHO
"Yes, I am convinced that COVID vaccines are safe once they have been licensed.",positive,WHO
All the vaccines are safe. It equally depends on your existence medical conditions. Coming to the 3 vaccines available in India.,positive,WHO
"Yes. Because Polio vaccine is safe. Diphtheria vaccine is safe ( remember the Iditarod Alaska race?) MMR ( measles, mump, rubella ) vaccine is safe.

"Yes, the Covid-19 vaccine is safe and has been safely given to hundreds of millions of people around the world. A small handful of people have had blood clots after being vaccinated, but this is because they have a very rare medical condition, and most were successfully treated.

A handful (way less than 100) have had allergic reactions to the vaccine, and have needed to be given an antihistamine after the shot to stop the allergic reaction. Would you rather take a large chance of being dead, or a small chance of needing to take an antihistamine? To me this is a pretty obvious choice.",positive,WHO
"No: I believe there is some risk in receiving a vaccine that has been rapidly developed, and tested. However I believe the risk of contracting Covid, and dying or getting permanent lung and or heart damage is much greater.",negative,WHO

"Being vaccinated is the ONLY way to stop the virus from spreading, infecting more people which could lead to more illness and death.",positive,WHO
because it was proven effective and safe which is good enough for me! I don’t want to stay susceptible to a deadly virus.,positive,WHO
"I would recommend getting vaccinated. It protects not only you but also those who are close to you and the people you love. If you don’t want to get it for your own protection, get it for them.",positive,WHO

"“Belief” is the wrong verb. The verb you are looking for is “know.” I know that the vaccines being given in the USA (Pfizer, JJ, Moderna) are very safe indeed. And I know the risks of these vaccines are much, much less than the risks of disease.",positive,WHO
"Yes, the Covid-19 vaccine is safe and has been safely given to hundreds of millions of people around the world. A small handful of people have had blood clots after being vaccinated, but this is because they have a very rare medical condition, and most were successfully treated. To give you an idea of how rare the chances of blood clots are, you have a greater chance of dying in an aircraft crash or about the same chance of dying from handling fireworks.",positive,WHO
"Yes it’s safe. Perfect it is not, however there have been very very few adverse reactions with over 1.3 billion doses given so far, and there have been over three million Covid19 deaths, and most likely the Covid19 deaths have been somewhat underreported. Of course it is safe and it is the only sure way to get the Covid19 pandemic under control!",positive,WHO
"“Safe” in this context is not binary. I believe the COVID-19 vaccine will make me, and the people around me, much safer than not being vaccinated makes me and the people around me. That’s what counts.",positive,WHO
"The vaccines have gone through the various testing (if i remember correctly six) phases before being administered. At least 400 millions across the world have received the vaccines, if not more. Of course < 1 % have had issues - mild, severe and fatal. No vaccine, developed even decades ago, is 100 % effective and safe.",positive,WHO
"The current Western Covid vaccines are extremely safe. In addition to the overwhelming numerical statistics, I can tell you anecdotally that I received my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine a month ago tomorrow, and other than a slightly sore arm for a day or so, I have had NO OTHER SIDE EFFECTS. I have not had any fever, sweats, chills, aches, pains nausea or vertigo. No trouble breathing, no loss of smell or taste, no loss of appetite and I did not miss any days at the gym or any long walks. You be safe too and get vaccinated.",positive,WHO
"Absolutely not. Considering the only mRNA testing that’s been done was on ferrets, and all died. Some quickly and some later on. That’s why it was discontinued and didn’t go through the human trials. Why anyone would take this is beyond all comprehension. The media and government are pushing something that is a dangerous and unknown to the public behind what the fear mongering and pushing of this agenda is truly about.",negative,WHO
You would be safe even without taking the vaccine. This whole COVID-19 was a sham and just political. You have a better chance of dying from the common flu than you do from the Coronavirus.,negative,WHO
"Because so far, nearly 100 million doses of vaccine have been given and there has been only one death which might, possibly, have been due to a bad reaction to the vaccine. One in 100 million is a lot less than the risk of dying from, say, eating a toffee.",positive,WHO
"Yes. Properly tested on those valiant volunteers, and 95% effective, I’ll get the vaccine as soon as it’s available.",positive,WHO
"No - you simply can’t “trust” that the COVID-19 vaccine is safe.  I have had problems with vaccines before, from spending a few days in bed after flu shots to spending 4 months at home with a ‘kidney infection’ and paralysis after the polio vaccine in 1963. At least 10% of the polio vaccine was contaminated with SV40, a kidney virus.",negative,WHO
No - you simply can’t “trust” that the COVID-19 vaccine is safe. The short term data is revealing an alarming number and array of symptoms and deaths that are being dismissed as coincidental.,negative,WHO
"I am not an Anti-vaxxer. I believe that the vaccines available for almost all deceases are effective and safe, because they have been proven to be so for many years.",positive,WHO
"The experimental vaccinations were rushed and not even tested on animals. Therefore “vaccine is safe"" is an oxymoron at best. It sounds like propaganda from the Globalists who want to depopulate Earth and tightly control the remainder as slaves.",negative,WHO
No I don’t. It’s experimental and wasn’t put through the trials it was supposed to be. Don’t be a human Guinea pig.,negative,WHO
"No, my best bet who was healthy as a horse just got her second dose 4 days ago and she died yesterday!!!",negative,WHO
Yes. I got both doses of the Maderna vaccine and am fully vaccinated. I encourage everyone to get vaccinated.,positive,WHO
"No, I don't believe it is safe. The push to get people to take an experimental drug with no history of being safe and effective is insanely stupid. It defies common sense and lacks any evidence of intelligence to fall for the scripted bullshit that's being played out. The vaccine is the pandemic not the virus. People are already dropping like flies.",negative,WHO
No. The people who got the shots a lot of them will probably die. When a corona virus come back around those people will get very sick and a lot will die.,negative,WHO
The animal tests they've done in the past killed the animals that had got the shots and then when exposed to corona virus naturally they got sick and died.,negative,WHO
Intelligent people are strive to protect from COVID-19 and get vaccines. Because vaccine can create a huge resistance for COVID-19 and reduce deaths.,positive,WHO
"Absolutely not. Considering the only mRNA testing that’s been done was on ferrets, and all died. Some quickly and some later on. ",negative,WHO

"No, since I do not get flu shots I will not get COVID-19 vaccination. Remarkably, I do not get sick and would like to keep that way!!",negative,WHO
"It is not some mysterious juice that Pharma companies want to inject in you, It has been thoroughly tested and approved by qualified people.",positive,WHO
No I am not convinced! My main concern is the findings and destruction of the Corona viruses. There is so little talk and research done about this aspect.,negative,WHO
"I say so far so good. The test went well, about 21,000 people got the Pfizer vaccine.",positive,WHO
"Not at all in such a corrupt evil world, NOT! Vaccines always contained malicious ingredients and ulterior motives! Must boycott al synthetic Rx and warn others! :",negative,WHO
"I will definitely trust a COVID-19 vaccine. And most likely will get one as soon as it is available here in Nepal. By the time it does become available here, most likely any delayed side effects will have begun to appear.",positive,WHO
Yes. No reason not to trust these vaccines. Companies performed the standard clinical process and released information throughout the programs.,positive,WHO
No. Not enough testing for me to feel safe. I have heart issues and keep reading about heart patients having heart attacks within the day or next day.,negative,WHO
"Yes it’s safe.  Side effects usually occur within the first few days of getting a vaccine. Since the first mass vaccination programme started in early December 2020, hundreds of millions of vaccine doses have been administered.",positive,WHO
"There have been concerns about COVID-19 vaccines making people sick with COVID-19. But none of the approved vaccines contains the live virus that causes COVID-19, which means that COVID-19 vaccines cannot make you sick with COVID-19.",positive,WHO
Yes totally convinced. at the end of the day it is just another flu virus we are fighting,positive,WHO
No vaccine is perfect. No COVID vaccine will be perfect.,negative,WHO
You cannot trust the Covid19 vaccine as the number of deaths from this vaccine are pretty significant. The number of people having severe symptoms from this vaccine are in quadruple digits.,negative,WHO
"I believe that the vaccine is far safer than the disease. The statistics on this are pretty clear. A bit more than 590,000 people in the US have died from COVID-19. A handful (way less than 100) have had allergic reactions to the vaccine, and have needed to be given an antihistamine after the shot to stop the allergic reaction. Would you rather take a large chance of being dead, or a small chance of needing to take an antihistamine? To me this is a pretty obvious choice.",positive,WHO
"No: I believe there is some risk in receiving a vaccine that has been rapidly developed, and tested. However I believe the risk of contracting Covid, and dying or getting permanent lung and or heart damage is much greater.",negative,WHO
"Yes, I am convinced that COVID vaccines are safe once they have been licensed.",positive,WHO
All the vaccines are safe. It equally depends on your existence medical conditions. Coming to the 3 vaccines available in India.,positive,WHO
"Yes. Because Polio vaccine is safe. Diphtheria vaccine is safe ( remember the Iditarod Alaska race?) MMR ( measles, mump, rubella ) vaccine is safe. Annual flu vaccine is safe. there are many safe vaccines proven over millions of not billions of doses and many years of use. Small pox vaccine is safe",positive,WHO
"I do believe in science.

A small handful of people have had blood clots after being vaccinated, but this is because they have a very rare medical condition, and most were successfully treated. To give you an idea of how rare the chances of blood clots are, you have a greater chance of dying in an aircraft crash or about the same chance of dying from handling fireworks.",positive,WHO
"Yes it’s safe. Perfect it is not, however there have been very very few adverse reactions with over 1.3 billion doses given so far, and there have been over three million Covid19 deaths, and most likely the Covid19 deaths have been somewhat underreported. Of course it is safe and it is the only sure way to get the Covid19 pandemic under control!",positive,WHO
"“Safe” in this context is not binary. I believe the COVID-19 vaccine will make me, and the people around me, much safer than not being vaccinated makes me and the people around me. That’s what counts.",positive,WHO
"The vaccines have gone through the various testing (if i remember correctly six) phases before being administered. At least 400 millions across the world have received the vaccines, if not more. Of course < 1 % have had issues - mild, severe and fatal. No vaccine, developed even decades ago, is 100 % effective and safe.",positive,WHO
"The current Western Covid vaccines are extremely safe. In addition to the overwhelming numerical statistics, I can tell you anecdotally that I received my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine a month ago tomorrow, and other than a slightly sore arm for a day or so, I have had NO OTHER SIDE EFFECTS. I have not had any fever, sweats, chills, aches, pains nausea or vertigo. No trouble breathing, no loss of smell or taste, no loss of appetite and I did not miss any days at the gym or any long walks. You be safe too and get vaccinated.",positive,WHO
"Absolutely not. Considering the only mRNA testing that’s been done was on ferrets, and all died. Some quickly and some later on. That’s why it was discontinued and didn’t go through the human trials. Why anyone would take this is beyond all comprehension. The media and government are pushing something that is a dangerous and unknown to the public behind what the fear mongering and pushing of this agenda is truly about.",negative,WHO
You would be safe even without taking the vaccine. This whole COVID-19 was a sham and just political. You have a better chance of dying from the common flu than you do from the Coronavirus.,negative,WHO
"Because so far, nearly 100 million doses of vaccine have been given and there has been only one death which might, possibly, have been due to a bad reaction to the vaccine. One in 100 million is a lot less than the risk of dying from, say, eating a toffee.",positive,WHO
"Yes. Properly tested on those valiant volunteers, and 95% effective, I’ll get the vaccine as soon as it’s available.",positive,WHO
"No - you simply can’t “trust” that the COVID-19 vaccine is safe.  I have had problems with vaccines before, from spending a few days in bed after flu shots to spending 4 months at home with a ‘kidney infection’ and paralysis after the polio vaccine in 1963. At least 10% of the polio vaccine was contaminated with SV40, a kidney virus.",negative,WHO

Yes. I got both doses of the Maderna vaccine and am fully vaccinated. I encourage everyone to get vaccinated.,positive,WHO
"No, I don't believe it is safe. The push to get people to take an experimental drug with no history of being safe and effective is insanely stupid. It defies common sense and lacks any evidence of intelligence to fall for the scripted bullshit that's being played out. The vaccine is the pandemic not the virus. People are already dropping like flies.",negative,WHO
No. The people who got the shots a lot of them will probably die. When a corona virus come back around those people will get very sick and a lot will die.,negative,WHO
The animal tests they've done in the past killed the animals that had got the shots and then when exposed to corona virus naturally they got sick and died.,negative,WHO

No. Not enough testing for me to feel safe. I have heart issues and keep reading about heart patients having heart attacks within the day or next day.,negative,WHO
"Yes it’s safe.  Side effects usually occur within the first few days of getting a vaccine. Since the first mass vaccination programme started in early December 2020, hundreds of millions of vaccine doses have been administered.",positive,WHO

No vaccine is perfect. No COVID vaccine will be perfect.,negative,WHO
You cannot trust the Covid19 vaccine as the number of deaths from this vaccine are pretty significant. The number of people having severe symptoms from this vaccine are in quadruple digits.,negative,WHO
"I believe that the vaccine is far safer than the disease. The statistics on this are pretty clear. A bit more than 590,000 people in the US have died from COVID-19. A handful (way less than 100) have had allergic reactions to the vaccine, and have needed to be given an antihistamine after the shot to stop the allergic reaction. Would you rather take a large chance of being dead, or a small chance of needing to take an antihistamine? To me this is a pretty obvious choice.",positive,WHO
"No: I believe there is some risk in receiving a vaccine that has been rapidly developed, and tested. However I believe the risk of contracting Covid, and dying or getting permanent lung and or heart damage is much greater.",negative,WHO
"Yes, I am convinced that COVID vaccines are safe once they have been licensed.",positive,WHO
All the vaccines are safe. It equally depends on your existence medical conditions. Coming to the 3 vaccines available in India.,positive,WHO
"Yes. Because Polio vaccine is safe. Diphtheria vaccine is safe ( remember the Iditarod Alaska race?) MMR ( measles, mump, rubella ) vaccine is safe. Annual flu vaccine is safe. there are many safe vaccines proven over millions of not billions of doses and many years of use. Small pox vaccine is safe",positive,WHO

A handful (way less than 100) have had allergic reactions to the vaccine, and have needed to be given an antihistamine after the shot to stop the allergic reaction. Would you rather take a large chance of being dead, or a small chance of needing to take an antihistamine? To me this is a pretty obvious choice.",positive,WHO

You would be safe even without taking the vaccine. This whole COVID-19 was a sham and just political. You have a better chance of dying from the common flu than you do from the Coronavirus.,negative,WHO
"Because so far, nearly 100 million doses of vaccine have been given and there has been only one death which might, possibly, have been due to a bad reaction to the vaccine. One in 100 million is a lot less than the risk of dying from, say, eating a toffee.",positive,WHO

It defies common sense and lacks any evidence of intelligence to fall for the scripted bullshit that's being played out. The vaccine is the pandemic not the virus. People are already dropping like flies.",negative,WHO
No. The people who got the shots a lot of them will probably die. When a corona virus come back around those people will get very sick and a lot will die.,negative,WHO

No. Not enough testing for me to feel safe. I have heart issues and keep reading about heart patients having heart attacks within the day or next day.,negative,WHO

A handful (way less than 100) have had allergic reactions to the vaccine, and have needed to be given an antihistamine after the shot to stop the allergic reaction. Would you rather take a large chance of being dead, or a small chance of needing to take an antihistamine? To me this is a pretty obvious choice.",positive,WHO
"No: I believe there is some risk in receiving a vaccine that has been rapidly developed, and tested. However I believe the risk of contracting Covid, and dying or getting permanent lung and or heart damage is much greater.",negative,WHO
"Yes, I am convinced that COVID vaccines are safe once they have been licensed.",positive,WHO
All the vaccines are safe. It equally depends on your existence medical conditions. Coming to the 3 vaccines available in India.,positive,WHO

"I am not an Anti-vaxxer. I believe that the vaccines available for almost all deceases are effective and safe, because they have been proven to be so for many years.",negative,WHO
"The experimental vaccinations were rushed and not even tested on animals. Therefore “vaccine is safe"" is an oxymoron at best. It sounds like propaganda from the Globalists who want to depopulate Earth and tightly control the remainder as slaves.",positive,WHO
No I don’t. It’s experimental and wasn’t put through the trials it was supposed to be. Don’t be a human Guinea pig.,positive,WHO
"No, my best bet who was healthy as a horse just got her second dose 4 days ago and she died yesterday!!!",positive,WHO
Yes. I got both doses of the Maderna vaccine and am fully vaccinated. I encourage everyone to get vaccinated.,negative,WHO
"No, I don't believe it is safe. The push to get people to take an experimental drug with no history of being safe and effective is insanely stupid. It defies common sense and lacks any evidence of intelligence to fall for the scripted bullshit that's being played out. The vaccine is the pandemic not the virus. People are already dropping like flies.",positive,WHO
No. The people who got the shots a lot of them will probably die. When a corona virus come back around those people will get very sick and a lot will die.,positive,WHO
The animal tests they've done in the past killed the animals that had got the shots and then when exposed to corona virus naturally they got sick and died.,positive,WHO
Intelligent people are strive to protect from COVID-19 and get vaccines. Because vaccine can create a huge resistance for COVID-19 and reduce deaths.,negative,WHO

"There have been concerns about COVID-19 vaccines making people sick with COVID-19. But none of the approved vaccines contains the live virus that causes COVID-19, which means that COVID-19 vaccines cannot make you sick with COVID-19.",positive,WHO
Yes totally convinced. at the end of the day it is just another flu virus we are fighting,positive,WHO
No vaccine is perfect. No COVID vaccine will be perfect.,positive,WHO
You cannot trust the Covid19 vaccine as the number of deaths from this vaccine are pretty significant. The number of people having severe symptoms from this vaccine are in quadruple digits.,positive,WHO
"I believe that the vaccine is far safer than the disease. The statistics on this are pretty clear. A bit more than 590,000 people in the US have died from COVID-19. A handful (way less than 100) have had allergic reactions to the vaccine, and have needed to be given an antihistamine after the shot to stop the allergic reaction. Would you rather take a large chance of being dead, or a small chance of needing to take an antihistamine? To me this is a pretty obvious choice.",positive,WHO
"No: I believe there is some risk in receiving a vaccine that has been rapidly developed, and tested. However I believe the risk of contracting Covid, and dying or getting permanent lung and or heart damage is much greater.",positive,WHO
"Yes, I am convinced that COVID vaccines are safe once they have been licensed.",positive,WHO
All the vaccines are safe. It equally depends on your existence medical conditions. Coming to the 3 vaccines available in India.,positive,WHO
"Yes. Because Polio vaccine is safe. Diphtheria vaccine is safe ( remember the Iditarod Alaska race?) MMR ( measles, mump, rubella ) vaccine is safe. Annual flu vaccine is safe. there are many safe vaccines proven over millions of not billions of doses and many years of use. Small pox vaccine is safe",positive,WHO

"Am immune i don't need any vaccine. And you guys should consider billions of us who are immune, stop pushing your poisonous vaccine to every single person on this earth, there is no such a thing.

"Vaccinated people’s chances of ever getting covid are reduced, so they aren’t transmitting to the extent that the unvaccinated are.",positive,Daily Mail
"Double vaccinated people can still get covid and spread it, but because we are not likely to get it so badly it’s likely that we will have less viral load therefore spread it less.",positive,Daily Mail
"Fully vaccinated people are less likely (1/10th the risk or less) to get a detectable infection. No infection, no spreading!",positive,Daily Mail
"This is a recent research publication. If you are vaccinated you have a far lower likelihood of getting infected in the first place. If infected you will have a lower viral load, so less likely to pass it on. You will also be infectious for a shorter time.",positive,Daily Mail

"Yes, the Covid-19 vaccine is safe and has been safely given to hundreds of millions of people around the world. A small handful of people have had blood clots after being vaccinated, but this is because they have a very rare medical condition, and most were successfully treated.
